# BookExchangeSimulation

Purchasing textbooks is a quarterly issue for all college students. With prohibitive prices, it is natural for there to exist a market for used textbooks. However, most individuals who buy textbooks end up holding on to them, preventing textbooks from being in use to other students. Creating a market among campus students to exchange old textbooks may potentially improve this educational pain point. In this paper, we propose a definition of this used book exchange market, and analyze simulated exchange policies over this market.
